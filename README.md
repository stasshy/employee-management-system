# employee-management-system
A Java application that simulates an academic staff payroll system, generating randomized employee data (permanent and hourly-based) with calculated monthly salaries based on rank and experience.

Features
Two Employee Types:

Permanent Staff (fixed salary + rank-based bonus)

Hourly-Based Staff (base pay + experience-based hourly rate)

OOP Principles Applied:

Inheritance (Academic â†’ PermanentStaff & HourlyBasedStaff)

Polymorphism (Different CalculateMonthlySalary() implementations)

Encapsulation (Private fields with getter methods)

Randomized Data Generation:

Random ranks (Bathmida enum)

Random experience levels (WorkingExperience enum)

Random worked hours (for hourly staff)
